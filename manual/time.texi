@node Time Basics
@section Time Basics
@cindex time

Discussing time in a technical manual can be difficult because the word
``time'' in English refers to lots of different things.  In this manual,
we use a rigorous terminology to avoid confusion, and the only thing we
use the simple word ``time'' for is to talk about the abstract concept.

A @dfn{calendar time}, sometimes called ``absolute time'',
is a point in the Earth's time continuum, for example
June 9, 2024, at 13:50:06.5 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)@.
@cindex calendar time
UTC, formerly called Greenwich Mean Time, is the primary time
standard on Earth, and is the basis for civil time and time zones.
@cindex Coordinated Universal Time
@cindex UTC

We don't speak of a ``date'', because that is inherent in a calendar
time.
@cindex date

An @dfn{interval} is a contiguous part of the time continuum between two
calendar times, for example the hour on June 9, 2024,
between 13:00 and 14:00 UTC.
@cindex interval

An @dfn{elapsed time} is the length of an interval, for example, 35
minutes.  People sometimes sloppily use the word ``interval'' to refer
to the elapsed time of some interval.
@cindex elapsed time
@cindex time, elapsed

An @dfn{amount of time} is a sum of elapsed times, which need not be of
any specific intervals.  For example, the amount of time it takes to
read a book might be 9 hours, independently of when and in how many
sittings it is read.

A @dfn{period} is the elapsed time of an interval between two events,
especially when they are part of a sequence of regularly repeating
events.
@cindex period of time

A @dfn{simple calendar time} is a calendar time represented as an
elapsed time since a fixed, implementation-specific calendar time
called the @dfn{epoch}.  This representation is convenient for doing
calculations on calendar times, such as finding the elapsed time
between two calendar times.  Simple calendar times are independent of
time zone; they represent the same instant in time regardless of where
on the globe the computer is.

POSIX says that simple calendar times do not include leap seconds, but
some (otherwise POSIX-conformant) systems can be configured to include
leap seconds in simple calendar times.
@cindex leap seconds
@cindex seconds, leap
@cindex simple time
@cindex simple calendar time
@cindex calendar time, simple
@cindex epoch

A @dfn{broken-down time} is a calendar time represented by its
components in the Gregorian calendar: year, month, day, hour, minute,
and second.  A broken-down time value is relative to a specific time
zone, and so it is also sometimes called a @dfn{local time}.
Broken-down times are most useful for input and output, as they are
easier for people to understand, but more difficult to calculate with.
@cindex broken-down time
@cindex local time
@cindex Gregorian calendar
@cindex calendar, Gregorian

A @dfn{time zone} is a single fixed offset from UTC, along with
a @dfn{time zone abbreviation} that is a string of characters
that can include ASCII alphanumerics, @samp{+}, and @samp{-}.
For example, the current time zone in Japan is
9 hours ahead (east) of the Prime Meridian with abbreviation @t{"JST"}.

A @dfn{time zone ruleset} maps each simple calendar time to a single
time zone.  For example, Paris's time zone ruleset might list over a
dozen time zones that Paris has experienced during its history.

@dfn{CPU time} measures the amount of time that a single process has
actively used a CPU to perform computations.  It does not include the
time that process has spent waiting for external events.  The system
tracks the CPU time used by each process separately.
@cindex CPU time

@dfn{Processor time} measures the amount of time @emph{any} CPU has
been in use by @emph{any} process.  It is a basic system resource,
since there's a limit to how much can exist in any given interval (the
elapsed time of the interval times the number of CPUs in the computer)

People often call this CPU time, but we reserve the latter term in
this manual for the definition above.
@cindex processor time

@node Time Types
@section Time Types

ISO C and POSIX define several data types for representing elapsed
times, simple calendar times, and broken-down times.

@deftp {Data Type} clock_t
@standards{ISO, time.h}
@code{clock_t} is used to measure processor and CPU time.
It may be an integer or a floating-point type.
Its values are counts of @dfn{clock ticks} since some arbitrary event
in the past.
The number of clock ticks per second is system-specific.
@xref{Processor And CPU Time}, for further detail.
@cindex clock ticks
@cindex ticks, clock
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} time_t
@standards{ISO, time.h}
@code{time_t} is the simplest data type used to represent simple
calendar time.

In ISO C, @code{time_t} can be either an integer or a real floating
type, and the meaning of @code{time_t} values is not specified.  The
only things a strictly conforming program can do with @code{time_t}
values are: pass them to @code{difftime} to get the elapsed time
between two simple calendar times (@pxref{Calculating Elapsed Time}),
and pass them to the functions that convert them to broken-down time
(@pxref{Broken-down Time}).

On POSIX-conformant systems, @code{time_t} is an integer type and its
values represent the number of seconds elapsed since the @dfn{POSIX Epoch},
which is January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)@.
The count of seconds ignores leap seconds.  Additionally, POSIX.1-2024
added the requirement that @code{time_t} be at least 64 bits wide.

@Theglibc{} additionally guarantees that @code{time_t} is a signed
type, and that all of its functions operate correctly on negative
@code{time_t} values, which are interpreted as times before the POSIX Epoch.
Functions like @code{localtime} assume the Gregorian calendar and UTC
even though this is historically inaccurate for dates before 1582,
for times before 1960, and for timestamps after the Gregorian calendar
and UTC will become obsolete.
@cindex epoch
@Theglibc{} also supports leap seconds as an option, in which case
@code{time_t} counts leap seconds instead of ignoring them.
Currently the @code{time_t} type is 64 bits wide on all platforms
supported by @theglibc{}, except that it is 32 bits wide on a few
older platforms unless you define @code{_TIME_BITS} to 64.
@xref{Feature Test Macros}.
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} {struct timespec}
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
@cindex timespec
@code{struct timespec} represents a simple calendar time, or an
elapsed time, with sub-second resolution.  It is declared in
@file{time.h} and has the following members:

@table @code
@item time_t tv_sec
The number of whole seconds elapsed since the epoch (for a simple
calendar time) or since some other starting point (for an elapsed
time).

@item long int tv_nsec
The number of nanoseconds elapsed since the time given by the
@code{tv_sec} member.

When @code{struct timespec} values are produced by @glibcadj{}
functions, the value in this field will always be greater than or
equal to zero, and less than 1,000,000,000.
When @code{struct timespec} values are supplied to @glibcadj{}
functions, the value in this field must be in the same range.
@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} {struct timeval}
@standards{BSD, sys/time.h}
@cindex timeval
@code{struct timeval} is an older type for representing a simple
calendar time, or an elapsed time, with sub-second resolution. It is
almost the same as @code{struct timespec}, but provides only
microsecond resolution.  It is declared in @file{sys/time.h} and has
the following members:

@table @code
@item time_t tv_sec
The number of whole seconds elapsed since the epoch (for a simple
calendar time) or since some other starting point (for an elapsed
time).

@item long int tv_usec
The number of microseconds elapsed since the time given by the
@code{tv_sec} member.

When @code{struct timeval} values are produced by @glibcadj{}
functions, the value in this field will always be greater than or
equal to zero, and less than 1,000,000.
When @code{struct timeval} values are supplied to @glibcadj{}
functions, the value in this field must be in the same range.
@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} {struct tm}
@standards{ISO, time.h}
This is the data type used to represent a broken-down time.  It has
separate fields for year, month, day, and so on.
@xref{Broken-down Time}, for further details.
@end deftp

@node Calculating Elapsed Time
@section Calculating Elapsed Time

Often, one wishes to calculate an elapsed time as the difference
between two simple calendar times.  @Theglibc{} provides only one
function for this purpose.

@deftypefun double difftime (time_t @var{end}, time_t @var{begin})
@standards{ISO, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
The @code{difftime} function returns the number of seconds of elapsed
time from calendar time @var{begin} to calendar time @var{end}, as
a value of type @code{double}.

On POSIX-conformant systems, the advantage of using
@samp{difftime (@var{end}, @var{begin})} over @samp{@var{end} - @var{begin}}
is that it will not overflow even if
@var{end} and @var{begin} are so far apart that a simple subtraction
would overflow.  However, if they are so far apart that a @code{double}
cannot exactly represent the difference, the result will be inexact.

On other systems, @code{time_t} values might be encoded in a way that
prevents subtraction from working directly, and then @code{difftime}
would be the only way to compute their difference.
@end deftypefun

@Theglibc{} does not provide any functions for computing the
difference between two values of type @w{@code{struct timespec}} or
@w{@code{struct timeval}}.  Here is one way to do this
calculation by hand.  It works even on peculiar operating systems
where the @code{tv_sec} member has an unsigned type.

@smallexample
@include timespec_subtract.c.texi
@end smallexample

@node Processor And CPU Time
@section Processor And CPU Time

If you're trying to optimize your program or measure its efficiency,
it's very useful to know how much processor time it uses.  For that,
calendar time and elapsed times are useless because a process may spend
time waiting for I/O or for other processes to use the CPU@.  However,
you can get the information with the functions in this section.

CPU time (@pxref{Time Basics}) is represented by the data type
@code{clock_t}, which is a number of @dfn{clock ticks}.  It gives the
total amount of time a process has actively used a CPU since some
arbitrary event.  On @gnusystems{}, that event is the creation of the
process.  While arbitrary in general, the event is always the same event
for any particular process, so you can always measure how much time on
the CPU a particular computation takes by examining the process' CPU
time before and after the computation.
@cindex CPU time
@cindex clock ticks
@cindex ticks, clock

@defvr Macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC
@standards{ISO, time.h}
The number of clock ticks per second.
@end defvr

On @gnulinuxhurdsystems{}, @code{clock_t} is equivalent to @code{long int} and
@code{CLOCKS_PER_SEC} is an integer value.  But in other systems, both
@code{clock_t} and the macro @code{CLOCKS_PER_SEC} can be either integer
or floating-point types.  Converting CPU time values to @code{double}
can help code be more portable no matter what the underlying
representation is.

Note that the clock can wrap around.  On a 32bit system with
@code{CLOCKS_PER_SEC} set to one million this function will return the
same value approximately every 72 minutes.

For additional functions to examine a process' use of processor time,
and to control it, see @ref{Resource Usage And Limitation}.

@node CPU Time
@subsection CPU Time Inquiry

To get a process' CPU time, you can use the @code{clock} function.  This
facility is declared in the header file @file{time.h}.
@pindex time.h

In typical usage, you call the @code{clock} function at the beginning
and end of the interval you want to time, subtract the values, and then
divide by @code{CLOCKS_PER_SEC} (the number of clock ticks per second)
to get processor time, like this:

@smallexample
@group
#include <time.h>

clock_t start, end;
double cpu_time_used;

start = clock();
@dots{} /* @r{Do the work.} */
end = clock();
cpu_time_used = ((double) (end - start)) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
@end group
@end smallexample

Do not use a single CPU time as an amount of time; it doesn't work that
way.  Either do a subtraction as shown above or query processor time
directly.  @xref{Processor Time}.

Different computers and operating systems vary wildly in how they keep
track of CPU time.  It's common for the internal processor clock
to have a resolution somewhere between a hundredth and millionth of a
second.

@deftypevr Macro int CLOCKS_PER_SEC
@standards{ISO, time.h}
The value of this macro is the number of clock ticks per second measured
by the @code{clock} function.  POSIX requires that this value be one
million independent of the actual resolution.
@end deftypevr

@deftypefun clock_t clock (void)
@standards{ISO, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
@c On Hurd, this calls task_info twice and adds user and system time
@c from both basic and thread time info structs.  On generic posix,
@c calls times and adds utime and stime.  On bsd, calls getrusage and
@c safely converts stime and utime to clock.  On linux, calls
@c clock_gettime.
This function returns the calling process' current CPU time.  If the CPU
time is not available or cannot be represented, @code{clock} returns the
value @code{(clock_t)(-1)}.
@end deftypefun


@node Processor Time
@subsection Processor Time Inquiry

The @code{times} function returns information about a process'
consumption of processor time in a @w{@code{struct tms}} object, in
addition to the process' CPU time.  @xref{Time Basics}.  You should
include the header file @file{sys/times.h} to use this facility.
@cindex processor time
@cindex CPU time
@pindex sys/times.h

@deftp {Data Type} {struct tms}
@standards{POSIX.1, sys/times.h}
The @code{tms} structure is used to return information about process
times.  It contains at least the following members:

@table @code
@item clock_t tms_utime
This is the total processor time the calling process has used in
executing the instructions of its program.

@item clock_t tms_stime
This is the processor time the system has used on behalf of the calling
process.

@item clock_t tms_cutime
This is the sum of the @code{tms_utime} values and the @code{tms_cutime}
values of all terminated child processes of the calling process, whose
status has been reported to the parent process by @code{wait} or
@code{waitpid}; see @ref{Process Completion}.  In other words, it
represents the total processor time used in executing the instructions
of all the terminated child processes of the calling process, excluding
child processes which have not yet been reported by @code{wait} or
@code{waitpid}.
@cindex child process

@item clock_t tms_cstime
This is similar to @code{tms_cutime}, but represents the total processor
time the system has used on behalf of all the terminated child processes
of the calling process.
@end table

All of the times are given in numbers of clock ticks.  Unlike CPU time,
these are the actual amounts of time; not relative to any event.
@xref{Creating a Process}.
@end deftp

@deftypevr Macro int CLK_TCK
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
This is an obsolete name for the number of clock ticks per second.  Use
@code{sysconf (_SC_CLK_TCK)} instead.
@end deftypevr

@deftypefun clock_t times (struct tms *@var{buffer})
@standards{POSIX.1, sys/times.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
@c On HURD, this calls task_info twice, for basic and thread times info,
@c adding user and system times into tms, and then gettimeofday, to
@c compute the real time.  On BSD, it calls getclktck, getrusage (twice)
@c and time.  On Linux, it's a syscall with special handling to account
@c for clock_t counts that look like error values.
The @code{times} function stores the processor time information for
the calling process in @var{buffer}.

The return value is the number of clock ticks since an arbitrary point
in the past, e.g. since system start-up.  @code{times} returns
@code{(clock_t)(-1)} to indicate failure.
@end deftypefun

@strong{Portability Note:} The @code{clock} function described in
@ref{CPU Time} is specified by the @w{ISO C} standard.  The
@code{times} function is a feature of POSIX.1.  On @gnusystems{}, the
CPU time is defined to be equivalent to the sum of the @code{tms_utime}
and @code{tms_stime} fields returned by @code{times}.

@node Getting the Time
@subsection Getting the Time

@Theglibc{} provides several functions for getting the current
calendar time, with different levels of resolution.

@deftypefun time_t time (time_t *@var{result})
@standards{ISO, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
This is the simplest function for getting the current calendar time.
It returns the calendar time as a value of type @code{time_t}; on
POSIX systems, that means it has a resolution of one second.  It
uses the same clock as @w{@samp{clock_gettime (CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE)}},
when the clock is available or @w{@samp{clock_gettime (CLOCK_REALTIME)}}
otherwise.

If the argument @var{result} is not a null pointer, the calendar time
value is also stored in @code{*@var{result}}.

This function cannot fail.
@end deftypefun

Some applications need more precise timekeeping than is possible with
a @code{time_t} alone.  Some applications also need more control over
what is meant by ``the current time.''  For these applications,
POSIX and @w{ISO C} provide functions to retrieve the time
with up to nanosecond precision, from a variety of different clocks.
Clocks can be system-wide, measuring time the same for all processes;
or they can be per-process or per-thread, measuring CPU time consumed
by a particular process, or some other similar resource.  Each clock
has its own resolution and epoch.  POSIX and @w{ISO C} also provide functions
for finding the resolution of a clock.  There is no function to
get the epoch for a clock; either it is fixed and documented, or the
clock is not meant to be used to measure absolute times.

@deftp {Data Type} clockid_t
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
The type @code{clockid_t} is used for constants that indicate which of
several POSIX system clocks one wishes to use.
@end deftp

All systems that support the POSIX functions will define at least
this clock constant:

@deftypevr Macro clockid_t CLOCK_REALTIME
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
This POSIX clock uses the POSIX Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC@.
It is close to, but not necessarily in lock-step with, the
clocks of @code{time} (above) and of @code{gettimeofday} (below).
@end deftypevr

@cindex monotonic time
A second clock constant which is not universal, but still very common,
is for a clock measuring @dfn{monotonic time}.  Monotonic time is
useful for measuring elapsed times, because it guarantees that those
measurements are not affected by changes to the system clock.

@deftypevr Macro clockid_t CLOCK_MONOTONIC
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
This system-wide POSIX clock continuously measures the advancement of
calendar time, ignoring discontinuous changes to the system's
setting for absolute calendar time.

The epoch for this clock is an unspecified point in the past.
The epoch may change if the system is rebooted or suspended.
Therefore, @code{CLOCK_MONOTONIC} cannot be used to measure
absolute time, only elapsed time.
@end deftypevr

The following clocks are defined by POSIX, but may not be supported by
all POSIX systems:

@deftypevr Macro clockid_t CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
This POSIX clock measures the amount of CPU time used by the calling
process.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr Macro clockid_t CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
This POSIX clock measures the amount of CPU time used by the calling
thread.
@end deftypevr

The following clocks are Linux extensions:

@deftypevr Macro clockid_t CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
@deftypevrx Macro clockid_t CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE
@deftypevrx Macro clockid_t CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE
@deftypevrx Macro clockid_t CLOCK_BOOTTIME
@deftypevrx Macro clockid_t CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM
@deftypevrx Macro clockid_t CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM
@deftypevrx Macro clockid_t CLOCK_TAI
@standards{Linux, time.h}
For details of these clocks, see the manual page
@manpageurl{clock_gettime,2}.
@end deftypevr

Systems may support additional clocks beyond those listed here.

@deftypefun int clock_gettime (clockid_t @var{clock}, struct timespec *@var{ts})
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
Get the current time according to the clock identified by @var{clock},
storing it as seconds and nanoseconds in @code{*@var{ts}}.
@xref{Time Types}, for a description of @code{struct timespec}.

The return value is @code{0} on success and @code{-1} on failure.  The
following @code{errno} error condition is defined for this function:

@table @code
@item EINVAL
The clock identified by @var{clock} is not supported.
@end table
@end deftypefun

@code{clock_gettime} reports the time scaled to seconds and
nanoseconds, but the actual resolution of each clock may not be as
fine as one nanosecond, and may not be the same for all clocks.  POSIX
also provides a function for finding out the actual resolution of a
clock:

@deftypefun int clock_getres (clockid_t @var{clock}, struct timespec *@var{res})
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
Get the actual resolution of the clock identified by @var{clock},
storing it in @code{*@var{ts}}.

For instance, if the clock hardware for @code{CLOCK_REALTIME}
uses a quartz crystal that oscillates at 32.768 kHz,
then its resolution would be 30.518 microseconds,
and @w{@samp{clock_getres (CLOCK_REALTIME, &r)}} would set
@code{r.tv_sec} to 0 and @code{r.tv_nsec} to 30518.

The return value is @code{0} on success and @code{-1} on failure.  The
following @code{errno} error condition is defined for this function:

@table @code
@item EINVAL
The clock identified by @var{clock} is not supported.
@end table
@end deftypefun

@strong{Portability Note:} On some systems, including systems that use
older versions of @theglibc{}, programs that use @code{clock_gettime}
or @code{clock_setres} must be linked with the @code{-lrt} library.
This has not been necessary with @theglibc{} since version 2.17.

The following @w{ISO C} macros and functions for higher-resolution
timestamps were standardized more recently than the POSIX functions,
so they are less portable to older POSIX systems.  However, the @w{ISO
C} functions are portable to C platforms that do not support POSIX.

@deftypevr Macro int TIME_UTC
@standards{ISO, time.h}
This is a positive integer constant designating a simple calendar time base.
In @theglibc{} and other POSIX systems,
this is equivalent to the POSIX @code{CLOCK_REALTIME} clock.
On non-POSIX systems, though, the epoch is implementation-defined.
@end deftypevr

Systems may support more than just this @w{ISO C} clock.

@deftypefun int timespec_get (struct timespec *@var{ts}, int @var{base})
@standards{ISO, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
Store into @code{*@var{ts}} the current time according to the @w{ISO
C} time @var{base}.

The return value is @var{base} on success and @code{0} on failure.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int timespec_getres (struct timespec *@var{res}, int @var{base})
@standards{ISO, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
If @var{ts} is non-null, store into @code{*@var{ts}} the resolution of
the time provided by @code{timespec_get} function for the @w{ISO C}
time @var{base}.

The return value is @var{base} on success and @code{0} on failure.
@end deftypefun

The previous functions, data types and constants are declared in @file{time.h}.
@Theglibc{} also provides an older function
for getting the current time with a resolution of microseconds.  This
function is declared in @file{sys/time.h}.

@deftypefun int gettimeofday (struct timeval *@var{tp}, void *@var{tzp})
@standards{BSD, sys/time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
Get the current calendar time, storing it as seconds and microseconds
in @code{*@var{tp}}.  @xref{Time Types}, for a description of
@code{struct timeval}.  The clock of @code{gettimeofday} is close to,
but not necessarily in lock-step with, the clocks of @code{time} and of
@w{@samp{clock_gettime (CLOCK_REALTIME)}} (see above).

On some historic systems, if @var{tzp} was not a null pointer,
information about a system-wide time zone would be written to
@code{*@var{tzp}}.  This feature is obsolete and not supported on
@gnusystems{}.  You should always supply a null pointer for this
argument.  Instead, use the facilities described in
@ref{Broken-down Time} for working with time zones.

This function cannot fail, and its return value is always @code{0}.

@strong{Portability Note:} POSIX.1-2024 removed this function.
Although @theglibc{} will continue to provide it indefinitely,
portable programs should use @code{clock_gettime} or
@code{timespec_get} instead.

@subsection Setting and Adjusting the Time

The clock hardware inside a modern computer is quite reliable, but it
can still be wrong.  The functions in this section allow one to set
the system's idea of the current calendar time, and to adjust the rate
at which the system counts seconds, so that the calendar time will
both be accurate, and remain accurate.

The functions in this section require special privileges to use.
@xref{Users and Groups}.

@deftypefun int clock_settime (clockid_t @var{clock}, const struct timespec *@var{ts})
@standards{POSIX, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
Change the current calendar time, according to the clock identified by
@var{clock}, to be the simple calendar time in @code{*@var{ts}}.

Not all of the system's clocks can be changed.  For instance, the
@code{CLOCK_REALTIME} clock can be changed (with the appropriate
privileges), but the @code{CLOCK_MONOTONIC} clock cannot.

Because simple calendar times are independent of time zone, this
function should not be used when the time zone changes (e.g.@: if the
computer is physically moved from one zone to another).  Instead, use
the facilities described in @ref{Time Zone State}.

@code{clock_settime} causes the clock to jump forwards or backwards,
which can cause a variety of problems.  Changing the
@code{CLOCK_REALTIME} clock with @code{clock_settime} does not affect
when timers expire (@pxref{Setting an Alarm}) or when sleeping
processes wake up (@pxref{Sleeping}), which avoids some of the
problems.  Still, for small changes made while the system is running,
it is better to use @code{ntp_adjtime} (below) to make a smooth
transition from one time to another.

The return value is @code{0} on success and @code{-1} on failure.  The
following @code{errno} error conditions are defined for this function:

@table @code
@item EINVAL
The clock identified by @var{clock} is not supported or cannot be set
at all, or the simple calendar time in @code{*@var{ts}} is invalid
(for instance, @code{ts->tv_nsec} is negative or greater than 999,999,999).

@item EPERM
This process does not have the privileges required to set the clock
identified by @var{clock}.
@end table

@strong{Portability Note}: On some systems, including systems that use
older versions of @theglibc{}, programs that use @code{clock_settime}
must be linked with the @code{-lrt} library.  This has not been
necessary with @theglibc{} since version 2.17.
@end deftypefun

@cindex time, high precision
@cindex clock, high accuracy
@cindex clock, disciplining
@pindex sys/timex.h
For systems that remain up and running for long periods, it is not
enough to set the time once; one should also @dfn{discipline} the
clock so that it does not drift away from the true calendar time.

The @code{ntp_gettime} and @code{ntp_adjtime} functions provide an
interface to monitor and discipline the system clock.  For example,
you can fine-tune the rate at which the clock ``ticks,'' and make
small adjustments to the current reported calendar time smoothly, by
temporarily speeding up or slowing down the clock.

These functions' names begin with @samp{ntp_} because they were
designed for use by programs implementing the Network Time Protocol to
synchronize a system's clock with other systems' clocks and/or with
external high-precision clock hardware.

These functions, and the constants and structures they use, are
declared in @file{sys/timex.h}.

@tindex struct ntptimeval
@deftp {Data Type} {struct ntptimeval}
This structure is used to report information about the system clock.
It contains the following members:
@table @code
@item struct timeval time
The current calendar time, as if retrieved by @code{gettimeofday}.
The @code{struct timeval} data type is described in
@ref{Time Types}.

@item long int maxerror
This is the maximum error, measured in microseconds.  Unless updated
via @code{ntp_adjtime} periodically, this value will reach some
platform-specific maximum value.

@item long int esterror
This is the estimated error, measured in microseconds.  This value can
be set by @code{ntp_adjtime} to indicate the estimated offset of the
system clock from the true calendar time.
@end table
@end deftp

@deftypefun int ntp_gettime (struct ntptimeval *@var{tptr})
@standards{GNU, sys/timex.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
@c Wrapper for adjtimex.
The @code{ntp_gettime} function sets the structure pointed to by
@var{tptr} to current values.  The elements of the structure afterwards
contain the values the timer implementation in the kernel assumes.  They
might or might not be correct.  If they are not, an @code{ntp_adjtime}
call is necessary.

The return value is @code{0} on success and other values on failure.  The
following @code{errno} error conditions are defined for this function:

@vtable @code
@item TIME_ERROR
The precision clock model is not properly set up at the moment, thus the
clock must be considered unsynchronized, and the values should be
treated with care.
@end vtable
@end deftypefun

@tindex struct timex
@deftp {Data Type} {struct timex}
This structure is used to control and monitor the system clock.  It
contains the following members:
@table @code
@item unsigned int modes
This variable controls whether and which values are set.  Several
symbolic constants have to be combined with @emph{binary or} to specify
the effective mode.  These constants start with @code{MOD_}.

@item long int offset
This value indicates the current offset of the system clock from the true
calendar time.  The value is given in microseconds.  If bit
@code{MOD_OFFSET} is set in @code{modes}, the offset (and possibly other
dependent values) can be set.  The offset's absolute value must not
exceed @code{MAXPHASE}.


@item long int frequency
This value indicates the difference in frequency between the true
calendar time and the system clock.  The value is expressed as scaled
PPM (parts per million, 0.0001%).  The scaling is @code{1 <<
SHIFT_USEC}.  The value can be set with bit @code{MOD_FREQUENCY}, but
the absolute value must not exceed @code{MAXFREQ}.

@item long int maxerror
This is the maximum error, measured in microseconds.  A new value can be
set using bit @code{MOD_MAXERROR}.  Unless updated via
@code{ntp_adjtime} periodically, this value will increase steadily
and reach some platform-specific maximum value.

@item long int esterror
This is the estimated error, measured in microseconds.  This value can
be set using bit @code{MOD_ESTERROR}.

@item int status
This variable reflects the various states of the clock machinery.  There
are symbolic constants for the significant bits, starting with
@code{STA_}.  Some of these flags can be updated using the
@code{MOD_STATUS} bit.

@item long int constant
This value represents the bandwidth or stiffness of the PLL (phase
locked loop) implemented in the kernel.  The value can be changed using
bit @code{MOD_TIMECONST}.

@item long int precision
This value represents the accuracy or the maximum error when reading the
system clock.  The value is expressed in microseconds.

@item long int tolerance
This value represents the maximum frequency error of the system clock in
scaled PPM@.  This value is used to increase the @code{maxerror} every
second.

@item struct timeval time
The current calendar time.

@item long int tick
The elapsed time between clock ticks in microseconds.  A clock tick is a
periodic timer interrupt on which the system clock is based.

@item long int ppsfreq
This is the first of a few optional variables that are present only if
the system clock can use a PPS (pulse per second) signal to discipline
the system clock.  The value is expressed in scaled PPM and it denotes
the difference in frequency between the system clock and the PPS signal.

@item long int jitter
This value expresses a median filtered average of the PPS signal's
dispersion in microseconds.

@item int shift
This value is a binary exponent for the duration of the PPS calibration
interval, ranging from @code{PPS_SHIFT} to @code{PPS_SHIFTMAX}.

@item long int stabil
This value represents the median filtered dispersion of the PPS
frequency in scaled PPM.

@item long int jitcnt
This counter represents the number of pulses where the jitter exceeded
the allowed maximum @code{MAXTIME}.

@item long int calcnt
This counter reflects the number of successful calibration intervals.

@item long int errcnt
This counter represents the number of calibration errors (caused by
large offsets or jitter).

@item long int stbcnt
This counter denotes the number of calibrations where the stability
exceeded the threshold.
@end table
@end deftp

@deftypefun int ntp_adjtime (struct timex *@var{tptr})
@standards{GNU, sys/timex.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
@c Alias to adjtimex syscall.
The @code{ntp_adjtime} function sets the structure specified by
@var{tptr} to current values.

In addition, @code{ntp_adjtime} updates some settings to match what
you pass to it in @code{*@var{tptr}}.  Use the @code{modes} element of
@code{*@var{tptr}} to select what settings to update.  You can set
@code{offset}, @code{freq}, @code{maxerror}, @code{esterror},
@code{status}, @code{constant}, and @code{tick}.

@code{modes} = zero means set nothing.

Only the superuser can update settings.

@c On Linux, ntp_adjtime() also does the adjtime() function if you set
@c modes = ADJ_OFFSET_SINGLESHOT (in fact, that is how GNU libc implements
@c adjtime()).  But this should be considered an internal function because
@c it's so inconsistent with the rest of what ntp_adjtime() does and is
@c forced in an ugly way into the struct timex.  So we don't document it
@c and instead document adjtime() as the way to achieve the function.

The return value is @code{0} on success and other values on failure.  The
following @code{errno} error conditions are defined for this function:

@table @code
@item TIME_ERROR
The high accuracy clock model is not properly set up at the moment, thus the
clock must be considered unsynchronized, and the values should be
treated with care.  Another reason could be that the specified new values
are not allowed.

@item EPERM
The process specified a settings update, but is not superuser.

@end table

For more details see @w{RFC 5905} (Network Time Protocol, Version 4) and
related documents.

@strong{Portability note:} Early versions of @theglibc{} did not
have this function, but did have the synonymous @code{adjtimex}.
@end deftypefun


@c On Linux, GNU libc implements adjtime() as a call to adjtimex().
@deftypefun int adjtime (const struct timeval *@var{delta}, struct timeval *@var{olddelta})
@standards{BSD, sys/time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
@c On hurd and mach, call host_adjust_time with a privileged port.  On
@c Linux, it's implemented in terms of adjtimex.  On other unixen, it's
@c a syscall.
This simpler version of @code{ntp_adjtime} speeds up or slows down the
system clock for a short time, in order to correct it by a small
amount.  This avoids a discontinuous change in the calendar time
reported by the @code{CLOCK_REALTIME} clock, at the price of having to
wait longer for the time to become correct.

The @var{delta} argument specifies a relative adjustment to be made to
the clock time.  If negative, the system clock is slowed down for a
while until it has lost this much elapsed time.  If positive, the system
clock is sped up for a while.

If the @var{olddelta} argument is not a null pointer, the @code{adjtime}
function returns information about any previous time adjustment that
has not yet completed.

The return value is @code{0} on success and @code{-1} on failure.  The
following @code{errno} error condition is defined for this function:

@table @code
@item EPERM
This process does not have the privileges required to adjust the
@code{CLOCK_REALTIME} clock.
@end table
@end deftypefun

For compatibility, @theglibc{} also provides several older functions
for controlling the system time.  New programs should prefer to use
the functions above.

@deftypefun int stime (const time_t *@var{newtime})
@standards{SVID, time.h}
@standards{XPG, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
Change the @code{CLOCK_REALTIME} calendar time to be the simple
calendar time in @code{*@var{newtime}}.  Calling this function is
exactly the same as calling @w{@samp{clock_settime (CLOCK_REALTIME)}},
except that the new time can only be set to a precision of one second.

This function is no longer available on @gnusystems{}, but it may be
the @emph{only} way to set the time on very old Unix systems, so we
continue to document it.  If it is available, it is declared in
@file{time.h}.

The return value is @code{0} on success and @code{-1} on failure.  The
following @code{errno} error condition is defined for this function:

@table @code
@item EPERM
This process does not have the privileges required to adjust the
@code{CLOCK_REALTIME} clock.
@end table
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int adjtimex (struct timex *@var{timex})
@standards{GNU, sys/timex.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
@code{adjtimex} is an older name for @code{ntp_adjtime}.
This function is only available on @gnulinuxsystems{}.
It is declared in @file{sys/timex.h}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int settimeofday (const struct timeval *@var{tp}, const void *@var{tzp})
@standards{BSD, sys/time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
Change the @code{CLOCK_REALTIME} calendar time to be the simple
calendar time in @code{*@var{newtime}}.  This function is declared in
@file{sys/time.h}.

When @var{tzp} is a null pointer, calling this function is exactly the
same as calling @w{@samp{clock_settime (CLOCK_REALTIME)}}, except that
the new time can only be set to a precision of one microsecond.

When @var{tzp} is not a null pointer, the data it points to @emph{may}
be used to set a system-wide idea of the current time zone.  This
feature is obsolete and not supported on @gnusystems{}.  Instead, use
the facilities described in @ref{Time Zone State} and in
@ref{Broken-down Time} for working with time zones.

The return value is @code{0} on success and @code{-1} on failure.  The
following @code{errno} error conditions are defined for this function:

@table @code
@item EPERM
This process does not have the privileges required to set the
@code{CLOCK_REALTIME} clock.

@item EINVAL
Neither @var{tp} nor @var{tzp} is a null pointer.  (For historical
reasons, it is not possible to set the current time and the current
time zone in the same call.)

@item ENOSYS
The operating system does not support setting time zone information, and
@var{tzp} is not a null pointer.

@node Broken-down Time
@subsection Broken-down Time
@cindex broken-down time
@cindex calendar time and broken-down time

Simple calendar times represent absolute times as elapsed times since
an epoch.  This is convenient for computation, but has no relation to
the way people normally think of calendar time.  By contrast,
@dfn{broken-down time} is a binary representation of calendar time
separated into year, month, day, and so on.  Although broken-down time
values are painful to calculate with, they are useful for printing
human readable time information.

A broken-down time value is always relative to a choice of time
zone, and it also indicates which time zone that is.

The symbols in this section are declared in the header file @file{time.h}.

@deftp {Data Type} {struct tm}
@standards{ISO, time.h}
This is the data type used to represent a broken-down time.  The structure
contains at least the following members, which can appear in any order.

@table @code
@item int tm_sec
This is the number of full seconds since the top of the minute (normally
in the range @code{0} through @code{59}, but the actual upper limit is
@code{60}, to allow for leap seconds if leap second support is
available).
@cindex leap second

@item int tm_min
This is the number of full minutes since the top of the hour (in the
range @code{0} through @code{59}).

@item int tm_hour
This is the number of full hours past midnight (in the range @code{0} through
@code{23}).

@item int tm_mday
This is the ordinal day of the month (in the range @code{1} through @code{31}).
Watch out for this one!  As the only ordinal number in the structure, it is
inconsistent with the rest of the structure.

@item int tm_mon
This is the number of full calendar months since the beginning of the
year (in the range @code{0} through @code{11}).  Watch out for this one!
People usually use ordinal numbers for month-of-year (where January = 1).

@item int tm_year
This is the number of full calendar years since 1900.

@item int tm_wday
This is the number of full days since Sunday (in the range @code{0} through
@code{6}).

@item int tm_yday
This is the number of full days since the beginning of the year (in the
range @code{0} through @code{365}).

@item int tm_isdst
@cindex daylight saving time
@cindex summer time
This is a flag that indicates whether daylight saving time is (or was, or
will be) in effect at the time described.  The value is positive if
daylight saving time is in effect, zero if it is not, and negative if the
information is not available.
Although this flag is useful when passing a broken-down time to the
@code{mktime} function, for other uses this flag should be ignored and
the @code{tm_gmtoff} and @code{tm_zone} fields should be inspected instead.

@item long int tm_gmtoff
This field describes the time zone that was used to compute this
broken-down time value, including any adjustment for daylight saving; it
is the number of seconds that you must add to UTC to get local time.
You can also think of this as the number of seconds east of the Prime Meridian.
For example, for U.S. Eastern Standard Time, the value is @code{-5*60*60}.

@item const char *tm_zone
This field is the abbreviation for the time zone that was used to compute this
broken-down time value.
@end table

@strong{Portability note:}  The @code{tm_gmtoff} and @code{tm_zone} fields
are derived from BSD and are POSIX extensions to @w{ISO C}@.
Code intended to be portable to operating systems that lack
these fields can instead use time zone state variables, although
those variables are unreliable when the @env{TZ} environment variable
has a geographical format.  @xref{Time Zone State}.

@standards{ISO, time.h}

@c  tz_convert dup @mtsenv @mtslocale @ascuheap @asulock @aculock @acsmem @acsfd
The @code{localtime} function converts the simple time pointed to by
@var{time} to broken-down time representation, expressed relative to the
user's specified time zone.

The return value is a pointer to a static broken-down time structure, which
might be overwritten by subsequent calls to @code{gmtime}
or @code{localtime}.  (No other library function overwrites the contents
of this object.)  In @theglibc{}, the structure's @code{tm_zone}
points to a string with a storage lifetime that lasts indefinitely;
on other platforms, the lifetime may expire when the @env{TZ}
environment variable is changed.

The return value is the null pointer if @var{time} cannot be represented
as a broken-down time; typically this is because the year cannot fit into
an @code{int}.

Calling @code{localtime} also sets the time zone state as if
@code{tzset} were called.  @xref{Time Zone State}.
@end deftypefun

Using the @code{localtime} function is a big problem in multi-threaded
programs.  The result is returned in a static buffer and this is used in
all threads.  A variant function avoids this problem.

The @code{localtime_r} function works just like the @code{localtime}
function.  It takes a pointer to a variable containing a simple time
and converts it to the broken-down time format.

But the result is not placed in a static buffer.  Instead it is placed
in the object of type @code{struct tm} to which the parameter
@var{resultp} points.  Also, the time zone state is not necessarily
set as if @code{tzset} were called.

If the conversion is successful the function returns a pointer to the
object the result was written into, i.e., it returns @var{resultp}.

@c  tz_convert dup @mtsenv @mtslocale @ascuheap @asulock @aculock @acsmem @acsfd
This function is similar to @code{localtime}, except that the broken-down

The broken-down time's @code{tm_gmtoff} is 0, and its
@code{tm_zone} is a string @t{"UTC"} with static storage duration.

As for the @code{localtime} function we have the problem that the result
is placed in a static variable.  A thread-safe replacement is also provided for
@code{gmtime}.

@c You'd think tz_convert could avoid some safety issues with
@c !use_localtime, but no such luck: tzset_internal will always bring
@c about all possible AS and AC problems when it's first called.

@c  tz_convert(gmtime_r) dup @mtsenv @mtslocale @ascuheap @asulock @aculock @acsmem @acsfd
This function is similar to @code{localtime_r}, except that it converts
just like @code{gmtime} the given time as UTC.

If the conversion is successful the function returns a pointer to the

The @code{mktime} function converts a broken-down time structure to a
simple time representation.  It also normalizes the contents of the
broken-down time structure, and fills in some components based on the
values of the others.

The @code{mktime} function ignores the specified contents of the
@code{tm_wday}, @code{tm_yday}, @code{tm_gmtoff}, and @code{tm_zone}
members of the broken-down time
structure.  It uses the values of the other components to determine the
calendar time; it's permissible for these components to have
unnormalized values outside their normal ranges.  The last thing that
@code{mktime} does is adjust the components of the @var{brokentime}
structure, including the members that were initially ignored.

If the specified broken-down time cannot be represented as a simple time,
@code{mktime} returns a value of @code{(time_t)(-1)} and does not modify
the contents of @var{brokentime}.

Calling @code{mktime} also sets the time zone state as if
@code{tzset} were called; @code{mktime} uses this information instead
of @var{brokentime}'s initial @code{tm_gmtoff} and @code{tm_zone}
members.  @xref{Time Zone State}.

@c Alias to mktime.

@code{timelocal} is functionally identical to @code{mktime}, but more
mnemonically named.  Note that it is the inverse of the @code{localtime}

@code{timegm} is functionally identical to @code{mktime} except it
always takes the input values to be UTC
regardless of any local time zone setting.

Note that @code{timegm} is the inverse of @code{gmtime}.

@strong{Portability note:}  @code{mktime} is essentially universally
available.  Although @code{timegm} is standardized by C23, some
other systems lack it; to be portable to them, you can set
the @env{TZ} environment variable to UTC, call @code{mktime}, then set
@env{TZ} back.

This function is similar to the @code{sprintf} function (@pxref{Formatted
Input}), but the conversion specifications that can appear in the format
template @var{template} are specialized for printing components of
@var{brokentime} according to the locale currently specified for
time conversion (@pxref{Locales}) and the current time zone
(@pxref{Time Zone State}).

Ordinary characters appearing in the @var{template} are copied to the
output string @var{s}; this can include multibyte character sequences.
Conversion specifiers are introduced by a @samp{%} character, followed
by an optional flag which can be one of the following.  These flags
are all GNU extensions.  The first three affect only the output of
numbers:

@table @code
@item _
The number is padded with spaces.

@item -
The number is not padded at all.

@item 0
The number is padded with zeros even if the format specifies padding
with spaces.

@item ^
The output uses uppercase characters, but only if this is possible
(@pxref{Case Conversion}).
@end table

The default action is to pad the number with zeros to keep it a constant
width.  Numbers that do not have a range indicated below are never
padded, since there is no natural width for them.

Following the flag an optional specification of the width is possible.
This is specified in decimal notation.  If the natural size of the
output of the field has less than the specified number of characters,
the result is written right adjusted and space padded to the given
size.

An optional modifier can follow the optional flag and width
specification.  The modifiers are:

@table @code
@item E
Use the locale's alternative representation for date and time.  This
modifier applies to the @code{%c}, @code{%C}, @code{%x}, @code{%X},
@code{%y} and @code{%Y} format specifiers.  In a Japanese locale, for
example, @code{%Ex} might yield a date format based on the Japanese
Emperors' reigns.

@item O
With all format specifiers that produce numbers: use the locale's
alternative numeric symbols.

With @code{%B}, @code{%b}, and @code{%h}: use the grammatical form for
month names that is appropriate when the month is named by itself,
rather than the form that is appropriate when the month is used as
part of a complete date.  The @code{%OB} and @code{%Ob} formats are a
C23 feature, specified in C23 to use the locale's `alternative' month
name; @theglibc{} extends this specification to say that the form used
in a complete date is the default and the form naming the month by
itself is the alternative.
@end table

If the format supports the modifier but no alternative representation
is available, it is ignored.

The conversion specifier ends with a format specifier taken from the
following list.  The whole @samp{%} sequence is replaced in the output
string as follows:

@table @code
@item %a
The abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale.

@item %A
The full weekday name according to the current locale.

@item %b
The abbreviated month name according to the current locale, in the
grammatical form used when the month is part of a complete date.
As a C23 feature (with a more detailed specification in @theglibc{}),
the @code{O} modifier can be used (@code{%Ob}) to get the grammatical
form used when the month is named by itself.

@item %B
The full month name according to the current locale, in the
grammatical form used when the month is part of a complete date.
As a C23 feature (with a more detailed specification in @theglibc{}),
the @code{O} modifier can be used (@code{%OB}) to get the grammatical
form used when the month is named by itself.

Note that not all languages need two different forms of the month
names, so the text produced by @code{%B} and @code{%OB}, and by
@code{%b} and @code{%Ob}, may or may not be the same, depending on
the locale.

@item %c
The preferred calendar time representation for the current locale.

@item %C
The century of the year.  This is equivalent to the greatest integer not
greater than the year divided by 100.

If the @code{E} modifier is specified (@code{%EC}), instead produces
the name of the period for the year (e.g.@: an era name) in the
locale's alternative calendar.

@item %d
The day of the month as a decimal number (range @code{01} through @code{31}).

@item %D
The date using the format @code{%m/%d/%y}.

@item %e
The day of the month like with @code{%d}, but padded with spaces (range
@code{ 1} through @code{31}).

@item %F
The date using the format @code{%Y-%m-%d}.  This is the form specified
in the @w{ISO 8601} standard and is the preferred form for all uses.

@item %g
The year corresponding to the ISO week number, but without the century
(range @code{00} through @code{99}).  This has the same format and value
as @code{%y}, except that if the ISO week number (see @code{%V}) belongs
to the previous or next year, that year is used instead.

@item %G
The year corresponding to the ISO week number.  This has the same format
and value as @code{%Y}, except that if the ISO week number (see
@code{%V}) belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used
instead.

@item %h
The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.  The action
is the same as for @code{%b}.

@item %H
The hour as a decimal number, using a 24-hour clock (range @code{00} through
@code{23}).

@item %I
The hour as a decimal number, using a 12-hour clock (range @code{01} through
@code{12}).

@item %j
The day of the year as a decimal number (range @code{001} through @code{366}).

@item %k
The hour as a decimal number, using a 24-hour clock like @code{%H}, but
padded with spaces (range @code{ 0} through @code{23}).

This format is a GNU extension.

@item %l
The hour as a decimal number, using a 12-hour clock like @code{%I}, but
padded with spaces (range @code{ 1} through @code{12}).

This format is a GNU extension.

@item %m
The month as a decimal number (range @code{01} through @code{12}).

@item %M
The minute as a decimal number (range @code{00} through @code{59}).

@item %n
A single @samp{\n} (newline) character.

@item %p
Either @samp{AM} or @samp{PM}, according to the given time value; or the
corresponding strings for the current locale.  Noon is treated as
@samp{PM} and midnight as @samp{AM}.  In most locales
@samp{AM}/@samp{PM} format is not supported, in such cases @t{"%p"}
yields an empty string.

@ignore
We currently have a problem with makeinfo.  Write @samp{AM} and @samp{am}
both results in `am'.  I.e., the difference in case is not visible anymore.
@end ignore
@item %P
Either @samp{am} or @samp{pm}, according to the given time value; or the
corresponding strings for the current locale, printed in lowercase
characters.  Noon is treated as @samp{pm} and midnight as @samp{am}.  In
most locales @samp{AM}/@samp{PM} format is not supported, in such cases
@t{"%P"} yields an empty string.

This format is a GNU extension.

@item %r
The complete calendar time using the AM/PM format of the current locale.

In the POSIX locale, this format is equivalent to @code{%I:%M:%S %p}.

@item %R
The hour and minute in decimal numbers using the format @code{%H:%M}.

@item %s
The number of seconds since the POSIX Epoch,
i.e., since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC@.
Leap seconds are not counted unless leap second support is available.

This format is a GNU extension.

@item %S
The seconds as a decimal number (range @code{00} through @code{60}).

@item %t
A single @samp{\t} (tabulator) character.

@item %T
The time of day using decimal numbers using the format @code{%H:%M:%S}.

@item %u
The day of the week as a decimal number (range @code{1} through
@code{7}), Monday being @code{1}.

@item %U
The week number of the current year as a decimal number (range @code{00}
through @code{53}), starting with the first Sunday as the first day of
the first week.  Days preceding the first Sunday in the year are
considered to be in week @code{00}.

@item %V
The @w{ISO 8601} week number as a decimal number (range @code{01}
through @code{53}).  ISO weeks start with Monday and end with Sunday.
Week @code{01} of a year is the first week which has the majority of its
days in that year; this is equivalent to the week containing the year's
first Thursday, and it is also equivalent to the week containing January
4.  Week @code{01} of a year can contain days from the previous year.
The week before week @code{01} of a year is the last week (@code{52} or
@code{53}) of the previous year even if it contains days from the new
year.

@item %w
The day of the week as a decimal number (range @code{0} through
@code{6}), Sunday being @code{0}.

@item %W
The week number of the current year as a decimal number (range @code{00}
through @code{53}), starting with the first Monday as the first day of
the first week.  All days preceding the first Monday in the year are
considered to be in week @code{00}.

@item %x
The preferred date representation for the current locale.

@item %X
The preferred time of day representation for the current locale.

@item %y
The year without a century as a decimal number (range @code{00} through
@code{99}).  This is equivalent to the year modulo 100.

If the @code{E} modifier is specified (@code{%Ey}), instead produces
the year number according to a locale-specific alternative calendar.
Unlike @code{%y}, the number is @emph{not} reduced modulo 100.
However, by default it is zero-padded to a minimum of two digits (this
can be overridden by an explicit field width or by the @code{_} and
@code{-} flags).

@item %Y
The year as a decimal number, using the Gregorian calendar.  Years
before the year @code{1} are numbered @code{0}, @code{-1}, and so on.

If the @code{E} modifier is specified (@code{%EY}), instead produces a
complete representation of the year according to the locale's
alternative calendar.  Generally this will be some combination of the
information produced by @code{%EC} and @code{%Ey}.  As a GNU
extension, the formatting flags @code{_} or @code{-} may be used with
this conversion specifier; they affect how the year number is printed.

@item %z
@w{RFC 5322}/@w{ISO 8601} style numeric time zone (e.g.,
@code{-0600} or @code{+0100}), or nothing if no time zone is
determinable.

In the POSIX locale, a full @w{RFC 5322} timestamp is generated by the format
@w{@t{"%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z"}} (or the equivalent
@w{@t{"%a, %d %b %Y %T %z"}}).

@item %Z
The time zone abbreviation (empty if the time zone can't be determined).

@item %%
A literal @samp{%} character.
@end table

The @var{size} parameter can be used to specify the maximum number of
characters to be stored in the array @var{s}, including the terminating
null character.  If the formatted time requires more than @var{size}
characters, @code{strftime} returns zero and the contents of the array
@var{s} are undefined.  Otherwise the return value indicates the
number of characters placed in the array @var{s}, not including the
terminating null character.

@emph{Warning:} This convention for the return value which is prescribed
in @w{ISO C} can lead to problems in some situations.  For certain
format strings and certain locales the output really can be the empty
string and this cannot be discovered by testing the return value only.
E.g., in most locales the AM/PM time format is not supported (most of
the world uses the 24 hour time representation).  In such locales
@t{"%p"} will return the empty string, i.e., the return value is
zero.  To detect situations like this something similar to the following
code should be used:

@smallexample
buf[0] = '\1';
len = strftime (buf, bufsize, format, tp);
if (len == 0 && buf[0] != '\0')
  @{
    /* Something went wrong in the strftime call.  */
    @dots{}
  @}
@end smallexample

If @var{s} is a null pointer, @code{strftime} does not actually write
anything, but instead returns the number of characters it would have written.

Calling @code{strftime} also sets the time zone state as if
@code{tzset} were called.  @xref{Time Zone State}.

For an example of @code{strftime}, see @ref{Time Functions Example}.

The @code{wcsftime} function is equivalent to the @code{strftime}
function with the difference that it operates on wide character
strings.  The buffer where the result is stored, pointed to by @var{s},
must be an array of wide characters.  The parameter @var{size} which
specifies the size of the output buffer gives the number of wide
characters, not the number of bytes.

Also the format string @var{template} is a wide character string.  Since
all characters needed to specify the format string are in the basic
character set it is portably possible to write format strings in the C
source code using the @code{L"@dots{}"} notation.  The parameter
@var{brokentime} has the same meaning as in the @code{strftime} call.

The @code{wcsftime} function supports the same flags, modifiers, and
format specifiers as the @code{strftime} function.

The return value of @code{wcsftime} is the number of wide characters
stored in @code{s}.  When more characters would have to be written than
can be placed in the buffer @var{s} the return value is zero, with the
same problems indicated in the @code{strftime} documentation.

@node Parsing Date and Time
@subsection Convert textual time and date information back

The @w{ISO C} standard does not specify any functions which can convert
the output of the @code{strftime} function back into a binary format.
This led to a variety of more-or-less successful implementations with
different interfaces over the years.  Then the Unix standard was
extended by the addition of two functions: @code{strptime} and
@code{getdate}.  Both have strange interfaces but at least they are
widely available.

The first function is rather low-level.  It is nevertheless frequently

The @code{strptime} function parses the input string @var{s} according
to the format string @var{fmt} and stores its results in the
structure @var{tp}.

The input string could be generated by a @code{strftime} call or
obtained any other way.  It does not need to be in a human-recognizable
format; e.g. a date passed as @t{"02:1999:9"} is acceptable, even
though it is ambiguous without context.  As long as the format string
@var{fmt} matches the input string the function will succeed.

The user has to make sure, though, that the input can be parsed in a
unambiguous way.  The string @t{"1999112"} can be parsed using the
format @t{"%Y%m%d"} as 1999-1-12, 1999-11-2, or even 19991-1-2.  It
is necessary to add appropriate separators to reliably get results.

The format string consists of the same components as the format string
of the @code{strftime} function.  The only difference is that the flags
@code{_}, @code{-}, @code{0}, and @code{^} are not allowed.
@comment Is this really the intention?  --drepper
Several of the distinct formats of @code{strftime} do the same work in
@code{strptime} since differences like case of the input do not matter.
For reasons of symmetry all formats are supported, though.

The modifiers @code{E} and @code{O} are also allowed everywhere the
@code{strftime} function allows them.

The formats are:

@table @code
@item %a
@itemx %A
The weekday name according to the current locale, in abbreviated form or
the full name.

@item %b
@itemx %B
@itemx %h
A month name according to the current locale.  All three specifiers
will recognize both abbreviated and full month names.  If the
locale provides two different grammatical forms of month names,
all three specifiers will recognize both forms.

As a GNU extension, the @code{O} modifier can be used with these
specifiers; it has no effect, as both grammatical forms of month
names are recognized.

@item %c
The date and time representation for the current locale.

@item %Ec
Like @code{%c} but the locale's alternative date and time format is used.

@item %C
The century of the year.

It makes sense to use this format only if the format string also
contains the @code{%y} format.

@item %EC
The locale's representation of the period.

Unlike @code{%C} it sometimes makes sense to use this format since some
cultures represent years relative to the beginning of eras instead of
using the Gregorian years.

@item %d
@item %e
The day of the month as a decimal number (range @code{1} through @code{31}).
Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

@item %Od
@itemx %Oe
Same as @code{%d} but using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

@item %D
Equivalent to @code{%m/%d/%y}.

@item %F
Equivalent to @code{%Y-%m-%d}, which is the @w{ISO 8601} date
format.

This is a GNU extension following an @w{ISO C99} extension to
@code{strftime}.

@item %g
The year corresponding to the ISO week number, but without the century
(range @code{00} through @code{99}).

@emph{Note:} Currently, this is not fully implemented.  The format is
recognized, input is consumed but no field in @var{tm} is set.

This format is a GNU extension following a GNU extension of @code{strftime}.

@item %G
The year corresponding to the ISO week number.

@emph{Note:} Currently, this is not fully implemented.  The format is
recognized, input is consumed but no field in @var{tm} is set.

This format is a GNU extension following a GNU extension of @code{strftime}.

@item %H
@itemx %k
The hour as a decimal number, using a 24-hour clock (range @code{00} through
@code{23}).

@code{%k} is a GNU extension following a GNU extension of @code{strftime}.

@item %OH
Same as @code{%H} but using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

@item %I
@itemx %l
The hour as a decimal number, using a 12-hour clock (range @code{01} through
@code{12}).

@code{%l} is a GNU extension following a GNU extension of @code{strftime}.

@item %OI
Same as @code{%I} but using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

@item %j
The day of the year as a decimal number (range @code{1} through @code{366}).

Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

@item %m
The month as a decimal number (range @code{1} through @code{12}).

Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

@item %Om
Same as @code{%m} but using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

@item %M
The minute as a decimal number (range @code{0} through @code{59}).

Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

@item %OM
Same as @code{%M} but using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

@item %n
@itemx %t
Matches any whitespace.

@item %p
@item %P
The locale-dependent equivalent to @samp{AM} or @samp{PM}.

This format is not useful unless @code{%I} or @code{%l} is also used.
Another complication is that the locale might not define these values at
all and therefore the conversion fails.

@code{%P} is a GNU extension following a GNU extension to @code{strftime}.

@item %r
The complete time using the AM/PM format of the current locale.

A complication is that the locale might not define this format at all
and therefore the conversion fails.

@item %R
The hour and minute in decimal numbers using the format @code{%H:%M}.

@code{%R} is a GNU extension following a GNU extension to @code{strftime}.

@item %s
The number of seconds since the POSIX Epoch,
i.e., since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC@.
Leap seconds are not counted unless leap second support is available.

@code{%s} is a GNU extension following a GNU extension to @code{strftime}.

@item %S
The seconds as a decimal number (range @code{0} through @code{60}).

Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

@strong{NB:} The Unix specification says the upper bound on this value
is @code{61}, a result of a decision to allow double leap seconds.  You
will not see the value @code{61} because no minute has more than one
leap second, but the myth persists.

@item %OS
Same as @code{%S} but using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

@item %T
Equivalent to the use of @code{%H:%M:%S} in this place.

@item %u
The day of the week as a decimal number (range @code{1} through
@code{7}), Monday being @code{1}.

Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

@emph{Note:} Currently, this is not fully implemented.  The format is
recognized, input is consumed but no field in @var{tm} is set.

@item %U
The week number of the current year as a decimal number (range @code{0}
through @code{53}).

Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

@item %OU
Same as @code{%U} but using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

@item %V
The @w{ISO 8601} week number as a decimal number (range @code{1}
through @code{53}).

Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

@emph{Note:} Currently, this is not fully implemented.  The format is
recognized, input is consumed but no field in @var{tm} is set.

@item %w
The day of the week as a decimal number (range @code{0} through
@code{6}), Sunday being @code{0}.

Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

@emph{Note:} Currently, this is not fully implemented.  The format is
recognized, input is consumed but no field in @var{tm} is set.

@item %Ow
Same as @code{%w} but using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

@item %W
The week number of the current year as a decimal number (range @code{0}
through @code{53}).

Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

@emph{Note:} Currently, this is not fully implemented.  The format is
recognized, input is consumed but no field in @var{tm} is set.

@item %OW
Same as @code{%W} but using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

@item %x
The date using the locale's date format.

@item %Ex
Like @code{%x} but the locale's alternative data representation is used.

@item %X
The time using the locale's time format.

@item %EX
Like @code{%X} but the locale's alternative time representation is used.

@item %y
The year without a century as a decimal number (range @code{0} through
@code{99}).

Leading zeroes are permitted but not required.

Note that it is questionable to use this format without
the @code{%C} format.  The @code{strptime} function does regard input
values in the range @math{68} to @math{99} as the years @math{1969} to
@math{1999} and the values @math{0} to @math{68} as the years
@math{2000} to @math{2068}.  But maybe this heuristic fails for some
input data.

Therefore it is best to avoid @code{%y} completely and use @code{%Y}
instead.

@item %Ey
The offset from @code{%EC} in the locale's alternative representation.

@item %Oy
The offset of the year (from @code{%C}) using the locale's alternative
numeric symbols.

@item %Y
The year as a decimal number, using the Gregorian calendar.

@item %EY
The full alternative year representation.

@item %z
The offset from UTC in @w{ISO 8601}/@w{RFC 5322} format.

@item %Z
The time zone abbreviation.

@emph{Note:} Currently, this is not fully implemented.  The format is
recognized, input is consumed but no field in @var{tm} is set.

@item %%
A literal @samp{%} character.
@end table

All other characters in the format string must have a matching character
in the input string.  Exceptions are whitespace characters in the input string
which can match zero or more whitespace characters in the format string.

@strong{Portability Note:} The XPG standard advises applications to use
at least one whitespace character (as specified by @code{isspace}) or
other non-alphanumeric characters between any two conversion
specifications.  @Theglibc{} does not have this limitation but
other libraries might have trouble parsing formats like
@t{"%d%m%Y%H%M%S"}.

The @code{strptime} function processes the input string from right to
left.  Each of the three possible input elements (whitespace, literal,
or format) are handled one after the other.  If the input cannot be
matched to the format string the function stops.  The remainder of the
format and input strings are not processed.

The function returns a pointer to the first character it was unable to
process.  If the input string contains more characters than required by
the format string the return value points right after the last consumed
input character.  If the whole input string is consumed the return value
points to the @code{NULL} byte at the end of the string.  If an error
occurs, i.e., @code{strptime} fails to match all of the format string,
the function returns @code{NULL}.
@end deftypefun

The specification of the function in the XPG standard is rather vague,
leaving out a few important pieces of information.  Most importantly, it
does not specify what happens to those elements of @var{tm} which are
not directly initialized by the different formats.  The
implementations on different Unix systems vary here.

The @glibcadj{} implementation does not touch those fields which are not
directly initialized.  Exceptions are the @code{tm_wday} and
@code{tm_yday} elements, which are recomputed if any of the year, month,
or date elements changed.  This has two implications:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Before calling the @code{strptime} function for a new input string, you
should prepare the @var{tm} structure you pass.  Normally this will mean
initializing all values to zero.  Alternatively, you can set all
fields to values like @code{INT_MAX}, allowing you to determine which
elements were set by the function call.  Zero does not work here since
it is a valid value for many of the fields.

Careful initialization is necessary if you want to find out whether a
certain field in @var{tm} was initialized by the function call.

@item
You can construct a @code{struct tm} value with several consecutive
@code{strptime} calls.  A useful application of this is e.g. the parsing
of two separate strings, one containing date information and the other
time information.  By parsing one after the other without clearing the
structure in-between, you can construct a complete broken-down time.
@end itemize

The following example shows a function which parses a string which
contains the date information in either US style or @w{ISO 8601} form:

@smallexample
const char *
parse_date (const char *input, struct tm *tm)
@{
  const char *cp;

  /* @r{First clear the result structure.}  */
  memset (tm, '\0', sizeof (*tm));

  /* @r{Try the ISO format first.}  */
  cp = strptime (input, "%F", tm);
  if (cp == NULL)
    @{
      /* @r{Does not match.  Try the US form.}  */
      cp = strptime (input, "%D", tm);
    @}

  return cp;
@}
@end smallexample

@node General Time String Parsing
@subsubsection A More User-friendly Way to Parse Times and Dates

The Unix standard defines another function for parsing date strings.
The interface is weird, but if the function happens to suit your
application it is just fine.  It is problematic to use this function
in multi-threaded programs or libraries, since it returns a pointer to
a static variable, and uses a global variable and global state based
on an environment variable.

@defvar getdate_err
@standards{Unix98, time.h}
This variable of type @code{int} contains the error code of the last
unsuccessful call to @code{getdate}.  Defined values are:

@table @math
@item 1
The environment variable @env{DATEMSK} is not defined or null.
@item 2
The template file denoted by the @env{DATEMSK} environment variable
cannot be opened.
@item 3
Information about the template file cannot retrieved.
@item 4
The template file is not a regular file.
@item 5
An I/O error occurred while reading the template file.
@item 6
Not enough memory available to execute the function.
@item 7
The template file contains no matching template.
@item 8
The input date is invalid, but would match a template otherwise.  This
includes dates like February 31st, and dates which cannot be represented
in a @code{time_t} variable.
@end table
@end defvar

@deftypefun {struct tm *} getdate (const char *@var{string})
@standards{Unix98, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtunsafe{@mtasurace{:getdate} @mtsenv{} @mtslocale{}}@asunsafe{@ascuheap{} @asulock{}}@acunsafe{@aculock{} @acsmem{} @acsfd{}}}
@c getdate @mtasurace:getdate @mtsenv @mtslocale @ascuheap @asulock @aculock @acsmem @acsfd
@c  getdate_r dup @mtsenv @mtslocale @ascuheap @asulock @aculock @acsmem @acsfd
The interface to @code{getdate} is the simplest possible for a function
to parse a string and return the value.  @var{string} is the input
string and the result is returned in a statically-allocated variable.

The details about how the string is processed are hidden from the user.
In fact, they can be outside the control of the program.  Which formats
are recognized is controlled by the file named by the environment
variable @env{DATEMSK}.  This file should contain
lines of valid format strings which could be passed to @code{strptime}.

The @code{getdate} function reads these format strings one after the
other and tries to match the input string.  The first line which
completely matches the input string is used.

Elements not initialized through the format string retain the values
present at the time of the @code{getdate} function call.

The formats recognized by @code{getdate} are the same as for
@code{strptime}.  See above for an explanation.  There are only a few
extensions to the @code{strptime} behavior:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If the @code{%Z} format is given the broken-down time is based on the
current time of the time zone matched, not of the current time zone of the
runtime environment.

@emph{Note}: This is not implemented (currently).  The problem is that
time zone abbreviations are not unique.  If a fixed time zone is assumed for a
given string (say @code{EST} meaning US East Coast time), then uses for
countries other than the USA will fail.  So far we have found no good
solution to this.

@item
If only the weekday is specified the selected day depends on the current
date.  If the current weekday is greater than or equal to the @code{tm_wday}
value the current week's day is chosen, otherwise the day next week is chosen.

@item
A similar heuristic is used when only the month is given and not the
year.  If the month is greater than or equal to the current month, then
the current year is used.  Otherwise it wraps to next year.  The first
day of the month is assumed if one is not explicitly specified.

@item
The current hour, minute, and second are used if the appropriate value is
not set through the format.

@item
If no date is given tomorrow's date is used if the time is
smaller than the current time.  Otherwise today's date is taken.
@end itemize

It should be noted that the format in the template file need not only
contain format elements.  The following is a list of possible format
strings (taken from the Unix standard):

@smallexample
%m
%A %B %d, %Y %H:%M:%S
%A
%B
%m/%d/%y %I %p
%d,%m,%Y %H:%M
at %A the %dst of %B in %Y
run job at %I %p,%B %dnd
%A den %d. %B %Y %H.%M Uhr
@end smallexample

As you can see, the template list can contain very specific strings like
@code{run job at %I %p,%B %dnd}.  Using the above list of templates and
assuming the current time is Mon Sep 22 12:19:47 EDT 1986, we can obtain the
following results for the given input.

@multitable {xxxxxxxxxxxx} {xxxxxxxxxx} {xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}
@item        Input @tab     Match @tab Result
@item        Mon @tab       %a @tab    Mon Sep 22 12:19:47 EDT 1986

@end multitable

The return value of the function is a pointer to a static variable of
type @w{@code{struct tm}}, or a null pointer if an error occurred.  The
result is only valid until the next @code{getdate} call, making this
function unusable in multi-threaded applications.

The @code{errno} variable is @emph{not} changed.  Error conditions are
stored in the global variable @code{getdate_err}.  See the
description above for a list of the possible error values.

@emph{Warning:} The @code{getdate} function should @emph{never} be
used in SUID-programs.  The reason is obvious: using the
@env{DATEMSK} environment variable you can get the function to open
any arbitrary file and chances are high that with some bogus input
(such as a binary file) the program will crash.

The @code{getdate_r} function is the reentrant counterpart of
@code{getdate}.  It does not use the global variable @code{getdate_err}
to signal an error, but instead returns an error code.  The same error
codes as described in the @code{getdate_err} documentation above are
used, with 0 meaning success.

Moreover, @code{getdate_r} stores the broken-down time in the variable
of type @code{struct tm} pointed to by the second argument, rather than
in a static variable.

This function is not defined in the Unix standard.  Nevertheless it is
available on some other Unix systems as well.

The warning against using @code{getdate} in SUID-programs applies to
@code{getdate_r} as well.

@node TZ Variable
@subsection Specifying the Time Zone with @env{TZ}

In POSIX systems, a user can specify the time zone by means of the
@env{TZ} environment variable.  For information about how to set
environment variables, see @ref{Environment Variables}.  The functions
for accessing the time zone are declared in @file{time.h}.
@pindex time.h
@cindex time zone

You should not normally need to set @env{TZ}.  If the system is
configured properly, the default time zone will be correct.  You might
set @env{TZ} if you are using a computer over a network from a
different time zone, and would like times reported to you in the time
zone local to you, rather than what is local to the computer.

The value of @env{TZ} can be in one of the following formats:

@itemize
@item
The @dfn{geographical format} specifies a location that stands for
the past and future time zones observed in that location.
@xref{Geographical TZ}.
Here are some examples:

@smallexample
Asia/Tokyo
America/New_York
/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Nuuk
@end smallexample

@item
The @dfn{proleptic format} represents a time zone that has always
been and always will be the same offset from UTC,
optionally with a simple daylight saving scheme that has always been
(and always will be) used every year.
@xref{Proleptic TZ}.
Here are some examples:

@smallexample
JST-9
EST+5EDT,M3.2.0/2,M11.1.0/2
<-02>+2<-01>,M3.5.0/-1,M10.5.0/0
@end smallexample

@item
The @dfn{colon format} begins with @samp{:}.  Here is an example.

@smallexample
:/etc/localtime
@end smallexample

@noindent
Each operating system can interpret this format differently;
in @theglibc{}, the @samp{:} is ignored and @var{characters}
are treated as if they specified the geographical or proleptic format.

@item
As an extension to POSIX, when the value of @env{TZ} is the empty string,
@theglibc{} uses UTC.
@end itemize

@pindex /etc/localtime
@pindex localtime
If the @env{TZ} environment variable does not have a value, the
implementation chooses a time zone by default.  In @theglibc{}, the
default time zone is like the specification @samp{TZ=/etc/localtime}
(or @samp{TZ=/usr/local/etc/localtime}, depending on how @theglibc{}
was configured; @pxref{Installation}).  Other C libraries use their own
rule for choosing the default time zone, so there is little we can say
about them.

@menu
* Geographical TZ::  @env{TZ} settings like @samp{America/New_York}.
* Proleptic TZ::     @env{TZ} settings like @samp{EST+5EDT,M3.2.0/2,M11.1.0/2}.
@end menu

@node Geographical TZ
@subsubsection Geographical Format for @env{TZ}

The geographical format names a time zone ruleset maintained by the
@url{http://www.iana.org/time-zones,
Time Zone Database} of time zone and daylight saving time
information for most regions of the world.
This public-domain database is maintained by a community of volunteers.
@cindex time zone database
@pindex /usr/share/zoneinfo
@pindex zoneinfo

If the format's @var{characters} begin with @samp{/}
it is an absolute file name;
otherwise the library looks for the file
@w{@file{/usr/share/zoneinfo/@var{characters}}}.  The @file{zoneinfo}
directory contains data files describing time zone rulesets in many
different parts of the world.  The names represent major cities, with
subdirectories for geographical areas; for example,
@file{America/New_York}, @file{Europe/London}, @file{Asia/Tokyo}.
These data files are installed by the system administrator, who also
sets @file{/etc/localtime} to point to the data file for the local time
zone ruleset.

If the file corresponding to @var{characters} cannot be read or has
invalid data, and @var{characters} are not in the proleptic format,
then @theglibc{} silently defaults to UTC@.  However, applications
should not depend on this, as @env{TZ} formats may be extended in the
future.

@node Proleptic TZ
@subsubsection Proleptic Format for @env{TZ}

Although the proleptic format is cumbersome and inaccurate for old timestamps,
POSIX.1-2017 and earlier specified details only for the proleptic format,
and you may need to use it on small systems that lack a time zone
information database.

The proleptic format is:

@smallexample
@r{@var{std}@var{offset}[@var{dst}[@var{offset}][@t{,}@var{start}[@t{/}@var{time}]@t{,}@var{end}[@t{/}@var{time}]]]}
@end smallexample

The @var{std} string specifies the time zone abbreviation,
which must be at least three bytes long,
and which can appear in unquoted or quoted form.
The unquoted form can contain only ASCII alphabetic characters.
The quoted form can also contain ASCII digits, @samp{+}, and @samp{-};
it is quoted by surrounding it by @samp{<} and @samp{>},
which are not part of the abbreviation.  There is no space
character separating the time zone abbreviation from the @var{offset}, so these
restrictions are necessary to parse the specification correctly.

The @var{offset} specifies the time value you must add to the local time
to get a UTC value.  It has syntax like:

@smallexample
[@t{+}|@t{-}]@var{hh}[@t{:}@var{mm}[@t{:}@var{ss}]]
@end smallexample

@noindent
This
is positive if the local time zone is west of the Prime Meridian and
negative if it is east; this is opposite from the usual convention
that positive time zone offsets are east of the Prime Meridian.
The hour @var{hh} must be between 0 and 24
and may be a single digit, and the minutes @var{mm} and seconds
@var{ss}, if present, must be between 0 and 59.

For example, to specify time in Panama, which is Eastern Standard Time
without any daylight saving time alternative:

@smallexample
EST+5
@end smallexample

When daylight saving time is used, the proleptic format is more complicated.
The initial @var{std} and @var{offset} specify the standard time zone, as
described above.  The @var{dst} string and @var{offset} are the abbreviation
and offset for the corresponding daylight saving time zone; if the
@var{offset} is omitted, it defaults to one hour ahead of standard time.

The remainder of the proleptic format, which starts with the first comma,
describes when daylight saving time is in effect.  This remainder is
optional and if omitted, @theglibc{} defaults to the daylight saving
rules that would be used if @env{TZ} had the value @t{"posixrules"}.
However, other POSIX implementations default to different daylight
saving rules, so portable @env{TZ} settings should not omit the
remainder.

In the remainder, the @var{start} field is when daylight saving time goes into
effect and the @var{end} field is when the change is made back to standard
time.  The following formats are recognized for these fields:

@table @code
@item J@var{n}
This specifies the Julian day, with @var{n} between @code{1} and @code{365}.
February 29 is never counted, even in leap years.

@item @var{n}
This specifies the Julian day, with @var{n} between @code{0} and @code{365}.
February 29 is counted in leap years.

@item M@var{m}.@var{w}.@var{d}
This specifies day @var{d} of week @var{w} of month @var{m}.  The day
@var{d} must be between @code{0} (Sunday) and @code{6}.  The week
@var{w} must be between @code{1} and @code{5}; week @code{1} is the
first week in which day @var{d} occurs, and week @code{5} specifies the
@emph{last} @var{d} day in the month.  The month @var{m} should be
between @code{1} and @code{12}.
@end table

The @var{time} fields specify when, in the local time currently in
effect, the change to the other time occurs.  They have the same
format as @var{offset} except the hours part can range from
@minus{}167 through 167; for example, @code{-22:30} stands for 01:30
the previous day and @code{25:30} stands for 01:30 the next day.  If
omitted, @var{time} defaults to @code{02:00:00}.

Here are example @env{TZ} values with daylight saving time rules.

@table @samp
@item EST+5EDT,M3.2.0/2,M11.1.0/2
In North American Eastern Standard Time (EST) and Eastern Daylight Time (EDT),
the normal offset from UTC is 5 hours; since this is
west of the Prime Meridian, the sign is positive.  Summer time begins on
March's second Sunday at 2:00am, and ends on November's first Sunday
at 2:00am.

@item IST-2IDT,M3.4.4/26,M10.5.0
Israel Standard Time (IST) and Israel Daylight Time (IDT) are 2 hours
ahead of the prime meridian in winter, springing forward an hour on
March's fourth Thursday at 26:00 (i.e., 02:00 on the first Friday on or
after March 23), and falling back on October's last Sunday at 02:00.

@item IST-1GMT0,M10.5.0,M3.5.0/1
Irish Standard Time (IST) is 1 hour behind the Prime Meridian in
summer, falling forward to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, the Prime
Meridian's time), on October's last Sunday at 00:00 and springing back
on March's last Sunday at 01:00.  This is an example of ``negative
daylight saving''; here,  daylight saving time is one hour west of
standard time instead of the more usual one hour east.

@item <-02>+2<-01>,M3.5.0/-1,M10.5.0/0
Most of Greenland is 2 hours behind UTC in winter.  Clocks follow the European
Union rules of springing forward by one hour on March's last Sunday at
01:00 UTC (@minus{}01:00 local time) and falling back on October's
last Sunday at 01:00 UTC (00:00 local time).
The numeric abbreviations @samp{-02} and @samp{-01} stand
for standard and daylight saving time, respectively.
@end table

The schedule of daylight saving time in any particular jurisdiction has
changed over the years.  To be strictly correct, the conversion of dates
and times in the past should be based on the schedule that was in effect
then.  However, the proleptic format does not let you specify how the
schedule has changed from year to year.  The most you can do is specify
one particular schedule---usually the present day schedule---and this is
used to convert any date, no matter when.  For precise time zone
specifications, it is best to use the geographical format.
@xref{Geographical TZ}.

@node Time Zone State
@subsection State Variables for Time Zones

For compatibility with POSIX, @theglibc{} defines global state
variables that depend on time zone rules specified by the @env{TZ}
environment variable.  However, these state variables are obsolescent
and are planned to be removed in a future version of POSIX,
and programs generally should avoid them because they are not
thread-safe and their values are specified only when @env{TZ} uses the
proleptic format.  @xref{TZ Variable}.
Programs should instead use the @code{tm_gmtoff} and
@code{tm_zone} members of @code{struct tm}.  @xref{Broken-down Time}.

@deftypefun void tzset (void)
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{@mtsenv{} @mtslocale{}}@asunsafe{@ascuheap{} @asulock{}}@acunsafe{@aculock{} @acsmem{} @acsfd{}}}

@c  libc_lock_lock dup @asulock @aculock
@c  tzset_internal dup @mtsenv @mtslocale @ascuheap @asulock @aculock @acsmem @acsfd
@c  libc_lock_unlock dup @aculock
The @code{tzset} function initializes the state variables from
the value of the @env{TZ} environment variable.
It is not usually necessary for your program to call this function,
partly because your program should not use the state variables,
and partly because this function is called automatically
when you use the time conversion functions @code{localtime},
@code{mktime}, @code{strftime}, @code{strftime_l}, and
@code{wcsftime}, or the deprecated function @code{ctime}.
Behavior is undefined if one thread accesses any of these variables directly
while another thread is calling @code{tzset} or any other function
that is required or allowed to behave as if it called @code{tzset}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypevar {char *} tzname [2]
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
The array @code{tzname} contains two strings, which are
abbreviations of time zones (standard and Daylight
Saving) that the user has selected.  @code{tzname[0]} abbreviates
a standard time zone (for example, @t{"EST"}), and @code{tzname[1]}
abbreviates a time zone when daylight saving time is in use (for
example, @t{"EDT"}).  These correspond to the @var{std} and @var{dst}
strings (respectively) when the @env{TZ} environment variable
uses the proleptic format.
The string values are unspecified if @env{TZ} uses the geographical format,
so it is generally better to use the broken-down time structure's
@code{tm_zone} member instead.

In @theglibc{}, the strings have a storage lifetime that lasts indefinitely;
on some other platforms, the lifetime lasts only until @env{TZ} is changed.

The @code{tzname} array is initialized by @code{tzset}.
Though the strings are declared as @code{char *}
the user must refrain from modifying them.
Modifying the strings will almost certainly lead to trouble.

@end deftypevar

@deftypevar {long int} timezone
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
This contains the difference between UTC and local standard
time, in seconds west of the Prime Meridian.
For example, in the U.S. Eastern time
zone, the value is @code{5*60*60}.  Unlike the @code{tm_gmtoff} member
of the broken-down time structure, this value is not adjusted for
daylight saving, and its sign is reversed.
The value is unspecified if @env{TZ} uses the geographical format,
so it is generally better to use the broken-down time structure's
@code{tm_gmtoff} member instead.
@end deftypevar

@deftypevar int daylight
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}

This variable is nonzero if daylight saving time rules apply.
A nonzero value does not necessarily mean that daylight saving time is
now in effect; it means only that daylight saving time is sometimes in effect.
This variable has little or no practical use;
it is present for POSIX compatibility.

@node Setting an Alarm
@section Setting an Alarm

The @code{alarm} and @code{setitimer} functions provide a mechanism for a
process to interrupt itself in the future.  They do this by setting a
timer; when the timer expires, the process receives a signal.

@cindex setting an alarm
@cindex interval timer, setting
@cindex alarms, setting
@cindex timers, setting
Each process has three independent interval timers available:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A real-time timer that counts elapsed time.  This timer sends a
@code{SIGALRM} signal to the process when it expires.
@cindex real-time timer
@cindex timer, real-time

@item
A virtual timer that counts processor time used by the process.  This timer
sends a @code{SIGVTALRM} signal to the process when it expires.
@cindex virtual timer
@cindex timer, virtual

@item
A profiling timer that counts both processor time used by the process,
and processor time spent in system calls on behalf of the process.  This
timer sends a @code{SIGPROF} signal to the process when it expires.
@cindex profiling timer
@cindex timer, profiling

This timer is useful for profiling in interpreters.  The interval timer
mechanism does not have the fine granularity necessary for profiling
native code.
@c @xref{profil} !!!
@end itemize

You can only have one timer of each kind set at any given time.  If you
set a timer that has not yet expired, that timer is simply reset to the
new value.

You should establish a handler for the appropriate alarm signal using
@code{signal} or @code{sigaction} before issuing a call to
@code{setitimer} or @code{alarm}.  Otherwise, an unusual chain of events
could cause the timer to expire before your program establishes the
handler.  In this case it would be terminated, since termination is the
default action for the alarm signals.  @xref{Signal Handling}.

To be able to use the alarm function to interrupt a system call which
might block otherwise indefinitely it is important to @emph{not} set the
@code{SA_RESTART} flag when registering the signal handler using
@code{sigaction}.  When not using @code{sigaction} things get even
uglier: the @code{signal} function has fixed semantics with respect
to restarts.  The BSD semantics for this function is to set the flag.
Therefore, if @code{sigaction} for whatever reason cannot be used, it is
necessary to use @code{sysv_signal} and not @code{signal}.

The @code{setitimer} function is the primary means for setting an alarm.
This facility is declared in the header file @file{sys/time.h}.  The
@code{alarm} function, declared in @file{unistd.h}, provides a somewhat
simpler interface for setting the real-time timer.
@pindex unistd.h
@pindex sys/time.h

@deftp {Data Type} {struct itimerval}
@standards{BSD, sys/time.h}
This structure is used to specify when a timer should expire.  It contains
the following members:
@table @code
@item struct timeval it_interval
This is the period between successive timer interrupts.  If zero, the
alarm will only be sent once.

@item struct timeval it_value
This is the period between now and the first timer interrupt.  If zero,
the alarm is disabled.
@end table

The @code{struct timeval} data type is described in @ref{Time Types}.
@end deftp

@standards{BSD, sys/time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{@mtstimer{}}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
@c This function is marked with @mtstimer because the same set of timers
@c is shared by all threads of a process, so calling it in one thread
@c may interfere with timers set by another thread.  This interference
@c is not regarded as destructive, because the interface specification
@c makes this overriding while returning the previous value the expected
@c behavior, and the kernel will serialize concurrent calls so that the
@c last one prevails, with each call getting the timer information from
@c the timer installed by the previous call in that serialization.
The @code{setitimer} function sets the timer specified by @var{which}
according to @var{new}.  The @var{which} argument can have a value of
@code{ITIMER_REAL}, @code{ITIMER_VIRTUAL}, or @code{ITIMER_PROF}.

If @var{old} is not a null pointer, @code{setitimer} returns information
about any previous unexpired timer of the same kind in the structure it
points to.

The return value is @code{0} on success and @code{-1} on failure.  The
following @code{errno} error conditions are defined for this function:

@table @code
@item EINVAL
The timer period is too large.
@end table

@deftypefun int getitimer (int @var{which}, struct itimerval *@var{old})
@standards{BSD, sys/time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
The @code{getitimer} function stores information about the timer specified
by @var{which} in the structure pointed at by @var{old}.

The return value and error conditions are the same as for @code{setitimer}.
@end deftypefun

@vtable @code
@item ITIMER_REAL
@standards{BSD, sys/time.h}
This constant can be used as the @var{which} argument to the
@code{setitimer} and @code{getitimer} functions to specify the real-time
timer.

@item ITIMER_VIRTUAL
@standards{BSD, sys/time.h}
This constant can be used as the @var{which} argument to the
@code{setitimer} and @code{getitimer} functions to specify the virtual
timer.

@item ITIMER_PROF
@standards{BSD, sys/time.h}
This constant can be used as the @var{which} argument to the
@code{setitimer} and @code{getitimer} functions to specify the profiling
timer.

@standards{POSIX.1, unistd.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{@mtstimer{}}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
@c Wrapper for setitimer.
The @code{alarm} function sets the real-time timer to expire in
@var{seconds} seconds.  If you want to cancel any existing alarm, you
can do this by calling @code{alarm} with a @var{seconds} argument of
zero.

The return value indicates how many seconds remain before the previous
alarm would have been sent.  If there was no previous alarm, @code{alarm}
returns zero.
@end deftypefun

The @code{alarm} function could be defined in terms of @code{setitimer}
like this:

@smallexample
unsigned int
alarm (unsigned int seconds)
@{
  struct itimerval old, new;
  new.it_interval.tv_usec = 0;
  new.it_interval.tv_sec = 0;
  new.it_value.tv_usec = 0;
  new.it_value.tv_sec = (long int) seconds;
  if (setitimer (ITIMER_REAL, &new, &old) < 0)
    return 0;
  else
    return old.it_value.tv_sec;
@}
@end smallexample

There is an example showing the use of the @code{alarm} function in
@ref{Handler Returns}.

If you simply want your process to wait for a given number of seconds,
you should use the @code{sleep} function.  @xref{Sleeping}.

You shouldn't count on the signal arriving precisely when the timer
expires.  In a multiprocessing environment there is typically some
amount of delay involved.

@strong{Portability Note:} The @code{setitimer} and @code{getitimer}
functions are derived from BSD Unix, while the @code{alarm} function is
specified by POSIX@.  @code{setitimer} is more powerful than
@code{alarm}, but @code{alarm} is more widely used.

@node Sleeping
@section Sleeping

The function @code{sleep} gives a simple way to make the program wait
for a short interval.  If your program doesn't use signals (except to
terminate), then you can expect @code{sleep} to wait reliably throughout
the specified interval.  Otherwise, @code{sleep} can return sooner if a
signal arrives; if you want to wait for a given interval regardless of
signals, use @code{select} (@pxref{Waiting for I/O}) and don't specify
any descriptors to wait for.
@c !!! select can get EINTR; using SA_RESTART makes sleep win too.

@deftypefun {unsigned int} sleep (unsigned int @var{seconds})
@standards{POSIX.1, unistd.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtunsafe{@mtascusig{:SIGCHLD/linux}}@asunsafe{}@acunsafe{}}
@c On Mach, it uses ports and calls time.  On generic posix, it calls
@c nanosleep.  On Linux, it temporarily blocks SIGCHLD, which is MT- and
@c AS-Unsafe, and in a way that makes it AC-Unsafe (C-unsafe, even!).
The @code{sleep} function waits for @var{seconds} seconds or until a signal
is delivered, whichever happens first.

If @code{sleep} returns because the requested interval is over,
it returns a value of zero.  If it returns because of delivery of a
signal, its return value is the remaining time in the sleep interval.

The @code{sleep} function is declared in @file{unistd.h}.
@end deftypefun

Resist the temptation to implement a sleep for a fixed amount of time by
using the return value of @code{sleep}, when nonzero, to call
@code{sleep} again.  This will work with a certain amount of accuracy as
long as signals arrive infrequently.  But each signal can cause the
eventual wakeup time to be off by an additional second or so.  Suppose a
few signals happen to arrive in rapid succession by bad luck---there is
no limit on how much this could shorten or lengthen the wait.

Instead, compute the calendar time at which the program should stop
waiting, and keep trying to wait until that calendar time.  This won't
be off by more than a second.  With just a little more work, you can use
@code{select} and make the waiting period quite accurate.  (Of course,
heavy system load can cause additional unavoidable delays---unless the
machine is dedicated to one application, there is no way you can avoid
this.)

On some systems, @code{sleep} can do strange things if your program uses
@code{SIGALRM} explicitly.  Even if @code{SIGALRM} signals are being
ignored or blocked when @code{sleep} is called, @code{sleep} might
return prematurely on delivery of a @code{SIGALRM} signal.  If you have
established a handler for @code{SIGALRM} signals and a @code{SIGALRM}
signal is delivered while the process is sleeping, the action taken
might be just to cause @code{sleep} to return instead of invoking your
handler.  And, if @code{sleep} is interrupted by delivery of a signal
whose handler requests an alarm or alters the handling of @code{SIGALRM},
this handler and @code{sleep} will interfere.

On @gnusystems{}, it is safe to use @code{sleep} and @code{SIGALRM} in
the same program, because @code{sleep} does not work by means of
@code{SIGALRM}.

@deftypefun int nanosleep (const struct timespec *@var{requested_time}, struct timespec *@var{remaining_time})
@standards{POSIX.1, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
@c On Linux, it's a syscall.  On Mach, it calls gettimeofday and uses
@c ports.
If resolution to seconds is not enough, the @code{nanosleep} function can
be used.  As the name suggests the sleep interval can be specified in
nanoseconds.  The actual elapsed time of the sleep interval might be
longer since the system rounds the elapsed time you request up to the
next integer multiple of the actual resolution the system can deliver.

@code{*@var{requested_time}} is the elapsed time of the interval you
want to sleep.

If @var{remaining_time} is not the null pointer, the function returns as
@code{*@var{remaining_time}} the elapsed time left in the interval for which
you requested to sleep.  If the interval completed without getting
interrupted by a signal, this is zero.

@code{struct timespec} is described in @ref{Time Types}.

If the function returns because the interval is over, it returns zero.
Otherwise it returns @math{-1} and sets the global variable @code{errno} to
one of the following values:

@table @code
@item EINTR
The call was interrupted because a signal was delivered to the thread.
If the @var{remaining_time} parameter is not the null pointer, the structure
pointed to by @var{remaining_time} is updated to contain the remaining
elapsed time.

@item EINVAL
The nanosecond value in the @var{requested_time} parameter contains an
invalid value.  Either the value is negative or greater than or equal to
1000 million.

This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.  This
is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like memory, file
descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time @code{nanosleep} is
called.  If the thread gets canceled, these resources stay allocated
until the program ends.  To avoid this, calls to @code{nanosleep} should
be protected using cancellation handlers.

The @code{nanosleep} function is declared in @file{time.h}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int clock_nanosleep (clockid_t @var{clock}, int @var{flags}, const struct timespec *@var{requested_time}, struct timespec *@var{remaining_time})
@standards{POSIX.1-2001, time.h}
@safety{@prelim{}@mtsafe{}@assafe{}@acsafe{}}
This function is similar to @code{nanosleep} while additionally providing
the caller with a way to specify the clock to be used to measure elapsed
time and express the sleep interval in absolute or relative terms.  It
returns zero when returning because the interval is over, and a positive
error number corresponding to the error encountered otherwise.  This is
different from @code{nanosleep}, which returns @math{-1} upon failure and
sets the global variable @code{errno} according to the error encountered
instead.

Except for the return value convention and the way to communicate an error
condition the call:

@smallexample
nanosleep (@var{requested_time}, @var{remaining_time})
@end smallexample

is analogous to:

@smallexample
clock_nanosleep (CLOCK_REALTIME, 0, @var{requested_time}, @var{remaining_time})
@end smallexample

The @var{clock} argument specifies the clock to use.
@xref{Getting the Time}, for the @code{clockid_t} type and possible values
of @var{clock}.  Not all clocks listed are supported for use with
@code{clock_nanosleep}.  For details, see the manual page
@manpageurl{clock_nanosleep,2}.

The @var{flags} argument is either @code{0} or @code{TIMER_ABSTIME}.  If
@var{flags} is @code{0}, then @code{clock_nanosleep} interprets
@var{requested_time} as an interval relative to the current time specified
by @var{clock}.  If it is @code{TIMER_ABSTIME} instead, @var{requested_time}
specifies an absolute time measured by @var{clock}; if at the time of the
call the value requested is less than or equal to the clock specified, then
the function returns right away.  When @var{flags} is @code{TIMER_ABSTIME},
@var{remaining_time} is not updated.

The @code{clock_nanosleep} function returns error codes as positive return
values.  The error conditions for @code{clock_nanosleep} are the same as for
@code{nanosleep}, with the following conditions additionally defined:

@table @code
@item EINVAL
The @var{clock} argument is not a valid clock.

@item EOPNOTSUPP
The @var{clock} argument is not supported by the kernel for
@code{clock_nanosleep}.
