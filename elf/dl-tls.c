/* Surplus static TLS, GLRO(dl_tls_static_surplus), is used for

   - IE TLS in libc.so for all dlmopen namespaces except in the initial
     one where libc.so is not loaded dynamically but at startup time,
   - IE TLS in other libraries which may be dynamically loaded even in the
     initial namespace,
   - and optionally for optimizing dynamic TLS access.

   The maximum number of namespaces is DL_NNS, but to support that many
   namespaces correctly the static TLS allocation should be significantly
   increased, which may cause problems with small thread stacks due to the
   way static TLS is accounted (bug 11787).

   So there is a rtld.nns tunable limit on the number of supported namespaces
   that affects the size of the static TLS and by default it's small enough
   not to cause problems with existing applications. The limit is not
   enforced or checked: it is the user's responsibility to increase rtld.nns
   if more dlmopen namespaces are used.

   Audit modules use their own namespaces, they are not included in rtld.nns,
   but come on top when computing the number of namespaces.  */

  /* Determining the offset of the various parts of the static TLS
     block has several dependencies.  In addition we have to work
     around bugs in some toolchains.

     Each TLS block from the objects available at link time has a size
     and an alignment requirement.  The GNU ld computes the alignment
     requirements for the data at the positions *in the file*, though.
     I.e, it is not simply possible to allocate a block with the size
     of the TLS program header entry.  The data is laid out assuming
     that the first byte of the TLS block fulfills

       p_vaddr mod p_align == &TLS_BLOCK mod p_align

     This means we have to add artificial padding at the beginning of
     the TLS block.  These bytes are never used for the TLS data in
     this module but the first byte allocated must be aligned
     according to mod p_align == 0 so that the first byte of the TLS
     block is aligned according to p_vaddr mod p_align.  This is ugly
     and the linker can help by computing the offsets in the TLS block
     assuming the first byte of the TLS block is aligned according to
     p_align.

     The extra space which might be allocated before the first byte of
     the TLS block need not go unused.  The code below tries to use
     that memory for the next TLS block.  This can work if the total
     memory requirement for the next TLS block is smaller than the

  /* CONCURRENCY NOTES:

     The global dl_tls_dtv_slotinfo_list array contains for each module
     index the generation counter current when that entry was updated.
     This array never shrinks so that all module indices which were
     valid at some time can be used to access it.  Concurrent loading
     and unloading of modules can update slotinfo entries or extend
     the array.  The updates happen under the GL(dl_load_tls_lock) and
     finish with the release store of the generation counter to
     GL(dl_tls_generation) which is synchronized with the load of
     new_gen in the caller.  So updates up to new_gen are synchronized
     but updates for later generations may not be.

     Here we update the thread dtv from old_gen (== dtv[0].counter) to
     new_gen generation.  For this, each dtv[i] entry is either set to
     an unallocated state (set), or left unmodified (nop).  Where (set)
     may resize the dtv first if modid i >= dtv[-1].counter. The rules
     for the decision between (set) and (nop) are

     (1) If slotinfo entry i is concurrently updated then either (set)
         or (nop) is valid: TLS access cannot use dtv[i] unless it is
         synchronized with a generation > new_gen.

     Otherwise, if the generation of slotinfo entry i is gen and the
     loaded module for this entry is map then

     (2) If gen <= old_gen then do (nop).

     (3) If old_gen < gen <= new_gen then
         (3.1) if map != 0 then (set)
         (3.2) if map == 0 then either (set) or (nop).

     Note that (1) cannot be reliably detected, but since both actions
     are valid it does not have to be.  Only (2) and (3.1) cases need
     to be distinguished for which relaxed mo access of gen and map is
     enough: their value is synchronized when it matters.

     Note that a relaxed mo load may give an out-of-thin-air value since
     it is used in decisions that can affect concurrent stores.  But this
     should only happen if the OOTA value causes UB that justifies the
     concurrent store of the value.  This is not expected to be an issue
     in practice.  */
