/* This test checks that the dynamic linker correctly logs thread creation
   and destruction. It creates a detached thread followed by a joinable
   thread to exercise different code paths. A barrier is used to ensure
   the detached thread has started before the joinable one is created,
   making the test more deterministic. The tst-dl-debug-tid.sh shell script
   wrapper then verifies the LD_DEBUG output.  */
