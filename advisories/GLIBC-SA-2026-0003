wordexp with WRDE_REUSE and WRDE_APPEND may return uninitialized memory

Calling wordexp with WRDE_REUSE in conjunction with WRDE_APPEND in the
GNU C Library version 2.0 to version 2.42 may cause the interface to
return uninitialized memory in the we_wordv member, which on subsequent
calls to wordfree may abort the process.

The implementation of WRDE_REUSE in conjunction with WRDE_APPEND fails
to clear the we_wordc member of the structure, and as such, when new
words are added internally, a leading we_wordc count number of entries
are skipped since they are assumed initialized.  These skipped entries
are not initialized, but are the contents of a realloc-expanded array of
pointers.  If the caller inspects the we_wordv array, it will
dereference invalid pointers and crash. If the caller calls wordfree,
the malloc implementation may detect the invalid pointers and abort the
process.  Calls to wordexp using WRDE_REUSE and WRDE_APPEND have never
worked correctly and thus the existence of applications that make use of
this feature is unlikely.
