# The headers on most of these files indicate that glibc is the canonical
# source for these files, although in many cases there seem to be useful
# changes in the gnulib versions that could be merged back in. Not all gnulib
# files contain such a header and it is not always consistent in its format, so
# it would be useful to make sure that all gnulib files that are using glibc as
# upstream have a greppable header.
#
# These files are quite hard to find without a header to grep for and each file
# has to be compared manually so this list is likely incomplete or may contain
# errors.
